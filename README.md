# advent-of-code-23
 
My advent of code solutions. Some of them are nifty and I'd share them but most of them are submitted right after I finish them (i.e., they spit out the right answer) so reserve your own judgement for another day :).

I'm writing these in go because I like the language and don't get to write enough of it. Not going for speed, if I was I'd definitely be using python.

Some have tests where they're useful. For some solutions it's helpful for me to check sub-components as I iterate to make sure they work like I want them to. If I find the solution straight-forward, I usually just keep chuggin along.
